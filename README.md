# Neue [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/DoSomething/neue/dev.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/DoSomething/neue) 
This is [Neue](http://neue.dosomething.org), our interface framework and pattern library. It defines a set of base styles and common patterns shared throughout our website. It's a strong foundation for building beautiful interfaces.

Neue was built for our internal needs at DoSomething.org, but it could also work for your organization. Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own website and style guide, or read more about [why we open-source our code](https://blog.dosomething.org/we-open-sourced-our-code-heres-why-you-should-too/).

# Usage
You can get your own copy of Neue by [downloading a release](https://github.com/DoSomething/neue/releases) or by using [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install DoSomething/neue#^6.0.0
```

Include the bundled `dist/neue.css` and `dist/neue.js` in your page. Be sure to include jQuery 1.7+ and the bundled Modernizr build `dist/modernizr.js`. That's it! Check out the online [pattern library](http://neue.dosomething.org/) and start building.

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://www.github.com/DoSomething/neue/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) to set up Neue for local development.

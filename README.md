**DoSomething.org's default theme, but not terrible. This is the bleeding-edge "style guide".** This theme should be used as a basis for constructing application-specific templates across our web properties. See the included HTML files for implementation details.

You can run the styleguide on your local machine! Here's the steps:

  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Run `bundle install` to configure dependencies.
  3. Run `rackup` to start the server (or just link to Pow).
  4. Check it out in your browser!

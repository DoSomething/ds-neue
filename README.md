DS Neue
=======

This is a living styleguide. It catalogues the re-usable classes included in the DS Neue framework. Neue is made up of four pillars: typography, a fluid grid-based layout system, re-usable interface patterns, and animations. It's a strong foundation for building beautiful interfaces.

The styleguide is always available online at [styleguide.dosomething.org](http://styleguide.dosomething.org/).

You can also run the styleguide on your local machine! Here's the steps:

  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Run `bundle install` and `npm install` to configure dependencies.
  3. Run `grunt` to build CSS and JS from source (and watch for changes).
  3. Run `rackup` to start the server (or just link to Pow).
  4. Check it out in your browser!

# Contributing
Neue was built for our internal needs at DoSomething.org, but it could also work for your organization. Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own website and style guide, or read more about [why we open-source our code](https://blog.dosomething.org/we-open-sourced-our-code-heres-why-you-should-too/).

The latest version of the pattern library is always available online at [neue.dosomething.org](http://neue.dosomething.org/).


## Code Guidelines
Code guidelines for SCSS and JavaScript can be found as a `README` within their respective directories in the repo. We also use [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) and [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) to keep our code neat and tidy.

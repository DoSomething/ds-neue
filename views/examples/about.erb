    <p>We have 2,215,655 members (and counting!) who kick ass on causes they care about. Bullying. Animal cruelty. Homelessness. Cancer. The list goes on.</p>
    <p>We spearhead national campaigns so 13- to 25-year-olds can make an impact &mdash; without ever needing money, an adult, or a car. Over 2.4 million people took action through DoSomething.org in 2012. Why? Because apathy sucks.</p>

    <h3>Why become a member?</h3>
    
    <h4 class="headline-callout"><span>Become part of a national movement for social change.</span></h4>
    <p>Volunteering in one's school or community is great, but DoSomething.org is bigger than that. Membership allows yong people to join thousands of others in creating an enormous movement for social change.</p>
    
    <h4 class="headline-callout"><span>Take action on any cause, any time.</span></h4>
    <p>Whether a campaign or a project, DoSomething.org gives young people a platform to kick ass on whatever matters to them.</p>

    <h4 class="headline-callout"><span>Be famous.</span></h4>
    <p>We love when our members tell us the amazing stuff they're doing. What we love even more? Telling others about it. We feature our members on our blog, Facebook page, Twitter, events, and other outlets.</p>

    <h4 class="headline-callout"><span>Be eligible for mad money.</span></h4>
    <p>For school scholarships. For school projects. For entrepreneurial endeavors. Makin' it rain.</p>

    <h4 class="headline-callout"><span>Access to exclusive events.</span></h4>
    <p>We host the Do Something Awards, attend movie premieres, and go to other places we'll admit are pretty cool. We shake hands with a lot of celebs, which is sometimes weird when they go in for the hug. Our members could have the chance to hug a celeb also.</p>
